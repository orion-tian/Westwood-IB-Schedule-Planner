# Westwood-IB-Schedule-Planner
A website that generates personalized four-year schedules meeting International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma course requirements of Westwood High School. It was instrumental in supporting the IB coordinator during one-on-one meeting with around 280 freshmen and 190 sophomores during the 2019 and 2020 school years. This project was coded up using Javascript, HTML, and CSS, where classes and their pre-requisites are stored as a JSON file.

This is the default webpage that greets the user with a helpful reminder of the IB requirements at the top:

The user can then make their selections using the toggles and drop down menus:

Clicking generate will then reveal their personalized schedule, where blank cells denote a free class to take whatever they wish:

If their selection does not meet IB graduation requirements, the user will be notified of their error with a helpful explanation of why it does not meet the requirements:
